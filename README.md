This is TOTALLY a school projet. Do not take it seriously, really.

I had to make a website about an object on old retro movies, so I took tron and the laser insine and made a website out of it.
The general theme was retro vaporwave but I don't wanted to make something retro I wanted to make modern vaporwave so I'm actually pretty satisfied with the results, if you want 
to make a vaporwave website feel free to fork.

## Structure

The website is not using anykind of backend, to achieve a template system I used ajax from jQuery, this method allow me to edit my content pages in different files and then import them in the main files, so I don't copy paste the head, the nav and all of that in every files and I also get a dynamic no-reloading one page navigation system between all my pages.

This website is totally responsive btw.

## Stack

Usage of HTML is obvious, as for the styling I chosen Less and js and jquery for the scripts.

Less contain all my styling rules and variables trough different modules, each modules is for a component allowing easy edition of it's rules and styling. For the compilation every modules is imported in `main.less`, you just need to compile this one in a minified version in the dist dir and you're good to go.
